- Child NFTs representing individual tickets
- Enhanced ticket transferability and resale transparency as it makes transferring easier 
  and faster but safer from frauds.

#### AI Capabilities
- AI-powered event assistant to query all your doubts about 
- Intelligent query resolution for event-related questions
- Automated event content generation
